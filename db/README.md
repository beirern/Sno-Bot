# What might go in a DB

Here we put what I might've put in a DB if *symbols.json* was a much larger file.

## Symbols.json
This contains all the templates as keys and the templates or words that make up those templates. When crafting a sentence it imports the json file as a map to quickly retrieve the values it needs.

## Voices.js
This is a map of all the voices GCP offers for Text-to-Speech.
